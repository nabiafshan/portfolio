    "\n",
    "* Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as non-coding (i.e. don't code for proteins) RNAs greater than 200 nucleotides in length.\n",
    "* However, recently it was discovered that some open-reading frames within lncRNAs *can* be translated into small proteins (micropeptides).\n",
    "* Such lncRNAs are called `misannotated lncRNAs` and we want to identify them."

    "### What are the issues with identifying these `misannotated lncRNAs`?\n",
    "* Experimental methods:\n",
    "  * Expensive!\n",
    "  * Time-consuming!\n",
    "  * Cell specific. Need to do a very comprehensive search!\n",
    "  * Differences across species?\n",
    "* Computational methods:\n",
    "  * Coding/Non-Coding classifiers: Normal prediction methods are hamstrung because we don't know which lncRNAs are misannotated i.e. training datasets have wrong labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are 2 main problems:\n",
    "* A method able to identify `misannotated lncRNAs` by sequence alone would be amazing!\n",
    "  * It would save time, experimental costs, while being independent of cell-type and species.\n",
    "  * If we could generate a list of possible candidate `misannotated lncRNAs`, experimental validation would be a lot more directed.\n",
    "* Current labels of lncRNAs are wrong. Therefore, a prediction method that doesn't rely completely on labels would be ideal.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Our method addresses these problems by relying on *training dynamics of deep learning methods* to solve the problem of identifying `misannotated lncRNAs`."

    "### So, what are training dynamics?\n",
    "* Relying on training dynamics of deep learning models means that:\n",
    "  * At the end of every training epoch, we have the model make coding/non-coding predictions for the sequences in our test set. We save these predictions.\n",
    "  * Finally, we take the mean and standard deviation of coding/non-coding predictions over all epochs.\n",
    "* What we're looking for is sequences with these 2 characteristics:\n",
    "  1. labeled non-coding in the dataset (i.e. ground truth is non-coding)\n",
    "  2. consistently classified as coding across epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure demonstrates this idea:\n",
    "* Estimated coding probability across all training epochs shown for five example RNAs for the LSTM model.\n",
    "* We expect coding and non-coding RNAs to have high and low coding probabilities respectively; this is the case for examples A and E.\n",
    "* We are interested in lncRNAs—like B (ENST00000447563)—which have consistently high estimated coding probability, despite having the ground truth-label ‘Non-coding’.\n",
    "* C and D show examples of ambiguous samples, i.e. they show a large change in estimated coding probabilities as model training progresses, so we are not sure whether they are mislabeled or not.\n",

    "  * In other words, RNAs that fall in this region are consistently classified into the non-ground-truth (i.e. coding) class. \n",
